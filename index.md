# Why?

- We believe that permissioned blockchains run by independent NGOs offer the perfect balance of trust and performance. This can enable many use-cases like micropayments which are not feasible with Bitcoin or Ethereum.

- Our goal is to be more inclusive, transparent and trustworthy network than Indian banking system.


# How?

- Indium is a divisible asset running on [Interplanetary Database](https://ipdb.foundation/) which uses a scalable, permissioned blockchain database [BigChainDB](http://bigchaindb.com/). This enables low-cost and low-latency transactions while reducing the risks of other permissioned blockchains.

- We are also building tools making use of Indium coins. These include:

  1. A public tipping bot service that integrates well in Slack / Twitter / Reddit / Facebook communities. Alpha version is available for you to add to your Slack teams [here](https://slackbot.indium.org.in/).
  2. Fund-raising app for NGOs using Indium coins
  3. An Indium-based Q & A app (like StackOverflow or 21.co)
  4. Micro-task marketplace (like Fiverr)
  5. OpenBazaar integration

# Governance

- We plan to form a non-profit foundation on the lines of Ethereum Foundation to govern the development and advocacy.

- We will NOT be running any nodes ourselves, which removes the risk of censorship / transaction tampering.

- A whitepaper detailing our plans is currently being prepared. You are welcome to contribute to it. [Join our Slack!](https://indiumtalk.slack.com/). Use [this link](https://join.slack.com/indiumtalk/shared_invite/MTk4MDQwNzMwMDIzLTE0OTczODIwNDItMzBkY2RlMjk0Yg)

- Indium is a divisible asset whose ledge is maintained on IPDB. Since IPDB is a permissioned a blockchain, securing it is cheap and no reward needs to be given to miners for securing it. Instead, the initial supply of coins can be used to compensate the community. The plan is to cap the total supply at *100 billion* coins, and release of new coins every year at *1%* of this total supply. These will be used to raise funds and reward contributors for development and advocacy in *50:50* ratio. There is no founders' reward. 

# How To Participate?

- Coins are not available for sale at this stage. You can only get them by contributing to the development and promotion.

- We need programmers, system administrators, infosec experts, quality testers, designers and crypto-economists at this stage. We will also need technical writers, and evangelists very soon.

- Our code is on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/indium), and developer discussion happens in a [Slack](https://indiumtalk.slack.com/). Use [this link](https://join.slack.com/indiumtalk/shared_invite/MTk4MDQwNzMwMDIzLTE0OTczODIwNDItMzBkY2RlMjk0Yg) to join us. This is a public project and we would really like to have you on board.
