# Why?

- Currently, Ethereum is the only programmable cryptocurrency with a critical mass. We strongly believe that monocultures are bad for innovation, security and politics.

- We believe that India's cryptocurrency needs will be very different in terms of transaction cost / speed, mobile / offline userbase, new payment systems like UPI, and the regulatory environment. An independent blockchain will allow us to take decisions better suited to India's problems.

# How?

- We are currently developing a prototype with multiple approaches. We may end up forking [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) code or use something like [BigChainDB](http://bigchaindb.com/). Development will be open and architecture choices will be made transparently.

- We are also building tools making use of Indium coins. These include:

  1. A public tipping service (similar to ChangeTip which has shut down) that integrates well in Slack / Twitter / Reddit / Facebook communities.
  2. An Indium-based Q & A app (like StackOverflow)
  3. Remote task completion portal (like Fiverr)

# Governance

- We plan to form a non-profit foundation to govern the development and advocacy. We may have only a single authoritative node in the initial phase. We will provide detailed transaction history and database dumps to ensure transparency.

- A whitepaper detailing our plans is currently being prepared. You are welcome to contribute to it.

- The pre-launch phase will involve a centralized digital currency which will either act as IOU or be used for auctioning of the genesis block of the eventual production version. All decisions will be taken collaboratively and transparently. For the pre-launch phase, the plan is to cap the release of new coins every month at 5% of total supply of 100 million. These will be used for development, advocacy and miscellaneous in 40-40-20 ratio. There is no founders' reward. Developers, early adopters and promoters will be compensated as per their contribution.

# How To Participate?

- Our code is on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/indium), and developer discussion happens in a [Slack](https://indiumtalk.slack.com/). Use [this link](https://join.slack.com/indiumtalk/shared_invite/MTk4MDQwNzMwMDIzLTE0OTczODIwNDItMzBkY2RlMjk0Yg) to join us. This is a public project and we would really like to have you on board.
