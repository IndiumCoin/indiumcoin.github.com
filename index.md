# Why?

- Currently, Ethereum is the only programmable cryptocurrency with a critical mass. We strongly believe that monocultures are bad for innovation, security and politics.

- We believe that India's cryptocurrency needs will be very different in terms of transaction cost / speed, mobile / offline userbase, new payment systems like UPI, and the regulatory environment. An independent blockchain will allow us to take decisions better suited to India's needs.

# How?

- We are currently developing prototypes with multiple approaches. We may end up forking [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) code or use something like [BigChainDB](http://bigchaindb.com/). Development will be open and architecture choices will be made transparently. We are in the very early phase and all decisions are up for a discussion.

- We are also building tools making use of Indium coins. These include:

  1. A public tipping bot service (similar to [ChangeTip](http://www.changetip.com/) which has shut down) that integrates well in Slack / Twitter / Reddit / Facebook communities. Alpha version is available for you to add to your Slack teams [here](https://slackbot.indium.org.in/). Both the admins and Slack members are given some coins as joining bonus. 
  2. An Indium-based Q & A app (like StackOverflow or 21.co)
  3. Micro-task marketplace (like Fiverr)

# Governance

- We plan to form a non-profit foundation on the lines of Ethereum Foundation to govern the development and advocacy.

- A whitepaper detailing our plans is currently being prepared. You are welcome to contribute to it.

- The pre-launch phase will involve a centralized digital currency which will either act as IOU or be used for auctioning of the genesis block of the eventual decentralized version. All decisions will be taken collaboratively and transparently. For the pre-launch phase, the plan is to cap the total supply at *100 million* coins and release of new coins every month at *5%* of this total supply. These will be used to raise funds and reward contributors for development and advocacy in *50:50* ratio. There is no founders' reward. Developers, early adopters and evangelists will be compensated as per their contribution as decided by the community.

# How To Participate?

- As explained above, the initial set of coins are reserved for development and advocacy. The earlier you join and start contributing, the more will be your compensation. There are lots of apps to build and problems to solve. Dive in!

- Coins are not available for sale at this stage. You can only get them by contributing to the development and promotion. You can of course hire/fund developers or spread the word in your social network to do so.

- We need programmers, system administrators, infosec experts, quality testers, designers and crypto-economists at this stage. We will also need technical writers, and evangelists very soon.

- Our code is on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/indium), and developer discussion happens in a [Slack](https://indiumtalk.slack.com/). Use [this link](https://join.slack.com/indiumtalk/shared_invite/MTk4MDQwNzMwMDIzLTE0OTczODIwNDItMzBkY2RlMjk0Yg) to join us. This is a public project and we would really like to have you on board.
