# Why?

- Currently, Ethereum is the only programmable cryptocurrency with a critical mass. We strongly believe that monocultures are bad for innovation, security and politics. We are trying to complement Ethereum, not compete with it.

- We believe that India's cryptocurrency needs will be very different in terms of transaction cost / speed, mobile / offline userbase, new payment systems like UPI, and the regulatory environment. An independent blockchain will allow us to take decisions better suited to our problems.

# How?

- We are currently developing this system. We may end up forking [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) code or use something like [BigChainDB](http://bigchaindb.com/). Development will be open and architecture choices will be made transparently.

- We are also building tools making use of Indium coins. These include:

  1. A public tipping service (similar to ChangeTip which has shut down) that integrates well in Slack / Twitter / Reddit / Facebook communities.
  2. An Indium-based Q & A app (like StackOverflow)
  3. Remote task completion portal (like Fiverr)

# How To Participate?

- Our code is on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/indium), and developer discussion happens in a [Slack](https://indiumtalk.slack.com/). You can get an invite [here](https://indiuminvite.herokuapp.com/). This is a public project and we would really like to have you on board.
