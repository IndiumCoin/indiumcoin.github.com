# Why?

- We believe that permissioned blockchains run by independent NGOs offer the perfect balance of trust and performance/scalability. This can enable many use-cases like micropayments which are not feasible with Bitcoin or Ethereum. The initial coin supply can be used to incentivize developers to build apps around this coin and grow the ecosystem.

- Our goal is to be a very inclusive, transparent and trustworthy network.


# How?

- Indium is a divisible asset running on [Interplanetary Database](https://ipdb.foundation/). This enables zero-cost and almost-zero-latency transactions while avoiding many of the risks of permissioned blockchains.

- IPDB supports minimal, deterministic, stateless and therefore, safe smart contracts using IETF's [Cryptoconditions](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-01) standard. These smart contracts are much safer than Ethereum which has a Turing-complete computation model which is verify formally.

- Building on top of IPDB avoids the risk of censorship which typically comes in permissioned blockchains where the entity creating the coins is ALSO the entity running the nodes/network.

- We are also building various apps making use of Indium coins. These include:

  1. A public wallet + tipping/payment service that integrates well in Slack / Twitter / Reddit / Facebook communities. Alpha version is available for you to add to your Slack teams [here](https://slackbot.indium.org.in/).
  2. Fund-raising app for NGOs using Indium coins
  3. An Indium-based Q & A app (like StackOverflow or 21.co)
  4. Micro-task marketplace (like Fiverr)
  5. OpenBazaar integration

# Governance

- We plan to form a non-profit foundation on the lines of Ethereum Foundation to govern the development and advocacy.

- We will NOT be running any nodes ourselves, which eliminates the risk of censorship / transaction tampering.

- A whitepaper detailing our plans is currently being prepared. You are welcome to contribute to it. Use [this link](https://join.slack.com/indiumtalk/shared_invite/MTk4MDQwNzMwMDIzLTE0OTczODIwNDItMzBkY2RlMjk0Yg) to join our Slack. 

- Indium is a divisible asset whose ledger is maintained on IPDB. Since IPDB is a permissioned blockchain, securing it is cheap and we don't need to reward "miners" for securing the blockchain. Instead, the initial supply of coins can be used to incentivize the developers for building apps and growing the ecosystem. In a sense, Indium foundation will act like a non-profit VC fund. The plan is to cap the total supply in advance, and release *1%* coins every year. The remaining coins can be locked into multi-sig, timelock contracts.

- The grant of coins to developers will be done completely in a transparent, equitable and objectively verifiable manner based on proof-of-traction and proof-of-progress mechanisms. The details are being worked out and you are welcome to participate in fleshing this out.

# How To Participate?

- Coins are not available for sale at this stage. We have not yet decided whether we actually need an ICO for this or not.

- We need programmers, system administrators, infosec experts, quality testers, designers and crypto-economists at this stage. We will also need technical writers, and evangelists very soon.

- Our code is on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/indium), and developer discussion happens in a [Slack](https://indiumtalk.slack.com/). Use [this link](https://join.slack.com/indiumtalk/shared_invite/MTk4MDQwNzMwMDIzLTE0OTczODIwNDItMzBkY2RlMjk0Yg) to join us. This is a public project and we would really like to have you on board.
